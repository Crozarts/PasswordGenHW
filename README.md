# Password Generator Homework Assignment

## My Assignment

For this weeks homework I was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app had to run in the browser and also feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also had have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

This was the user story that we were given: 

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
 ## Feedback

 this project was very difficult to create, but I persevered with the help of the intructors and tutors.
